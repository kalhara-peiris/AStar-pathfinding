# A* Pathfinding Grid Implementation

This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid, where the grid can either be predefined or created by the user. The user can define obstacles, starting point, and ending point, and the program will compute the shortest path using the A* algorithm.

## Features:
- Option to choose between a predefined grid or creating a custom grid.
- Users can define obstacles on the grid.
- Users can specify a starting point and an ending point.
- The program computes the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
